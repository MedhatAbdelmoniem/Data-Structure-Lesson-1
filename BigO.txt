Task0::

The time complexity is O(1) as we are not doing anything except three lines of code


Task1::

The time complexity is O(n^2) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input and because we are not using Sets and Dictionaris


Task2::

The time complexity is O(n) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input

Task3::

as of part a  and b together the time complexity is O(nlogn) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input and we are sorting

Task4::

Without the sorting and the printing list the time complexity is O(n^2) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input and because we are not using Sets and Dictionaris
