Task0::

The time complexity is O(logn) as we are not doing anything except three lines of code


Task1::

The time complexity is O(n) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input


Task2::

The time complexity is O(n) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input

Task3::

as of part a The time complexity is O(n) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input

Task4::

Without the sorting and the printing list the time complexity is O(n) because we are looping one time and the loop increase depending on the input
